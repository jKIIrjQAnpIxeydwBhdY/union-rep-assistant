Article II- Union Security

2.1. It shall be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement shall become and remain members of the Union on the thirty-first (31st) day following the date this Article applies to their work location or their employment, whichever is later. The requirement of membership under this Article is satisfied by the payment of the financial obligations of the Union’s initiation fee and periodic dues uniformly imposed. The Union shall not ask or require the Employer to discharge any employee except in compliance with the law.

2.2 Upon receipt by the Employer of a letter from the Union’s Secretary-Treasurer requesting the discharge of an employee because the employee has not met the requirements of this Article, unless the Employer questions the propriety of doing so, the employee shall be discharged within fifteen (15) days of the letter if prior thereto the employee does not take proper steps to meet the requirements. If the Employer questions the propriety of the discharge, the Employer shall immediately submit the matter to the Arbitrator. If the Arbitrator determines that the employee has not complied with the requirements of this Article, the employee shall be discharged within ten (10) days after written notice of the determination has been given to the Employer. In the event that an employee is discharged under this section, the Union shall hold the Employer harmless and indemnify the Employer for any liability under this section.

2.3 The Union shall have the right to inspect all the Employer’s records and books including, but not limited to, the Employer’s Social Security reports, all payroll reports, and any other records of employment (except the salaries of non-Union supervisors) in order to determine compliance with this agreement. All benefit funds established or provided for under this Agreement shall have the same right to inspect as the Union.
