1. In the event the HERO Act is once again triggered, the parties agree Employers agree to adopt an airborne infectious disease exposure prevention plan no later than sixty (60) calendar days from the triggering of the HERO Act, by either adopting the model standard promulgated by the Commissioner of the Department of Labor in consultation with the Department of Health, or by establishing an alternative plan that is comparable to or better than the minimum standards provided by the model standard. The RAB and the Union agree that an Employer’s adoption of the model standard relevant to them shall satisfy that Employer’s obligation to adopt an airborne infectious disease exposure prevention plan. Any Employer seeking to adopt an alternative plan that is comparable to or better than the model plan shall submit such plan to the RAB and the Union at least fourteen (14) days prior to the proposed effective date of such alternative plan, and if neither the RAB nor the Union object to such plan, in writing, within the fourteen (14) day period, such alternative plan will satisfy the Employer’s obligation to adopt an airborne infectious disease exposure prevention plan.

2. The RAB, Employers, and the Union agree to establish joint labor-management workplace safety committees. The workplace safety committees will be organized by Employer, except where the parties mutually agree that another format is acceptable. The workplace safety committees shall be comprised of Employer representatives, selected in consultation with the RAB, Union representatives, and bargaining unit employee representatives as the Union may designate. The workplace safety committees shall meet as needed, upon the request of either the Employer or the Union, at such times and in such manner as the Employer, RAB and the Union may deem reasonable and proper. Each workplace safety committee so-established, will have the ability, consistent with S1034B, to: (a) raise health and safety concerns, hazards, complaints and violations to the Employer; (b) review any policy or procedures put in
