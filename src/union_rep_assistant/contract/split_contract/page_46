Re:  Health Care Savings (Basic Plan) and 2024 Ratification Bonus

Dear Manny:
The parties agree that a one-time ratification bonus will be paid to certain eligible employees (as discussed more fully below). This will confirm the details of that ratification bonus.

In accordance with the monthly rates of contributions set forth in Article XX, in 2024, the monthly rate of contribution to the Health Fund shall be $1,087.00 per covered employee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, the rate of contribution for the months of May 2024 and June 2024 (payable respectively on or before June 20, 2024 and July 20, 2024) shall be $50.00 per month per covered employee.

After the Union provides the RAB with notice that its membership has fully ratified this Agreement, each employee for whom the Employer is obligated to contribute to the Health Fund for the Basic Plan of benefits as of July 20, 2024, including part-time employees who work more than two (2) days per week, and those on leave for whom the employer is obligated to contribute to the Health Fund as of July 20, 2024, shall receive a one-time, lump-sum, ratification bonus of one thousand seven hundred eight-five dollars ($1785.00), minus all applicable taxes, withholdings and deductions. The ratification bonus will be paid on July 26, 2024, or 30 calendar days after ratification, whichever is later.

The parties agree that the ratification bonus shall not be considered compensation for hours of employment purposes, and instead shall be deemed excluded from the definition of regular rate for purposes of calculating overtime pay. For the avoidance of any doubt, any disputes over the ratification bonus made to eligible employees, including any disputes over pay arising from or relating to such payments, shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining agreement including, without limitation, any wage and hour claim.
