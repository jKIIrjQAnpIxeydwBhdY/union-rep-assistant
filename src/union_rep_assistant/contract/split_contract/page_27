Employer will receive six (6) days sick leave in a calendar year, commencing in the calendar year following the employee’s third anniversary of employment date. Such sick leave may be used for bona fide illness or injury, or to attend a doctor’s appointment or any other reason consistent with the New York City Earned Safe and Sick Time Act.

16.2. To receive paid sick leave, an eligible employee must notify their supervisor of their inability to report to work as scheduled at least two (2) hours prior to the employee’s scheduled starting time.

16.3. Sick leave not used by the end of the year shall not be carried over to the following year, but will be paid to the employee following the end of the calendar year.

16.4 Regular employees shall be permitted to use paid time off benefits in addition to paid sick leave provided under this Agreement (e.g., vacation, holidays, personal days) solely for those reasons specified in New York City Earned Safe and Sick Time Act, N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 20-911, et seq., and the New York Paid Sick Leave Law, N.Y. Labor Law § 196-b, to obtain a maximum of seven (7) paid sick days (up to 56 hours) annually.

The parties agree that on an annual basis, the paid leave benefits provided under this Agreement are comparable to or better than those provided under the New York City Earned Safe and Sick Time Act, N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 20-911, et seq., and the New York Paid Sick Leave Law, N.Y. Labor Law § 196-b. Therefore, the provisions of those Acts are hereby waived.
