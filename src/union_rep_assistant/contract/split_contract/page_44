not seek to be) named or representative plaintiffs (e.g., who are merely putative class or collective action members) are not required to initiate mediation in connection with this section; however, the Employee's claims will be a subject of the mediation process described in this section.

3. Unless otherwise agreed to by the mediating parties, at any time following ninety (90) days after the initiation of the mediation process, either the Employer or the Employee(s) may terminate mediation by written notice to the other side, and, in that event, no further mediation effort shall be required by this Agreement.

4. In the event that Employee(s) initiate litigation in a judicial forum on the Employee's wage and hour claims without first submitting to the mediation process described in this section and the Employer seeks to enforce the requirements of this paragraph, the Employer shall not seek dismissal of the judicial action but may seek to have the action stayed pending the completion of the mediation provided for herein.

5. The parties do not intend an Employee's substantive or recovery rights or any Employer defenses to be limited by virtue of the terms of this mediation process. Hence, during the pendency of the mediation process, any statutes of limitations and/or filing periods shall be tolled, and recovery of appropriate damages shall be permitted for all time periods during which mediation is occurring or has occurred. To the extent that the tolling described in this paragraph is deemed legally ineffective, and without conceding that any recovery is appropriate, the Employee(s) shall have the contractual right to seek recovery for any time period(s) that would have been tolled without having to exhaust the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in this Agreement.
