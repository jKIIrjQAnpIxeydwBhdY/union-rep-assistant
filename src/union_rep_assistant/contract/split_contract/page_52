arbitration shall be Roberta Golick, unless she is unable or unwilling to serve, in which case the parties shall agree upon an arbitrator, and failing agreement shall submit the case to arbitration before the American Arbitration Association, in New York City.

In 2010, the parties initiated the No-Discrimination Protocol. The No-Discrimination Protocol is applicable to all such claims. This Protocol was intended, and continues, to serve as an alternative to arbitrating the parties' disagreement on the Reserved Question. The parties agreed to include the No-Discrimination Protocol as part of the CBAs, as further modified in December 2015. The Union and the RAB agree that the provisions of the No-Discrimination Protocol do not resolve the Reserved Question. Neither the inclusion of the No-Discrimination Protocol in the CBAs nor the terms of the No-Discrimination Protocol shall be understood to advance either party's contention as to the meaning of the CBAs with regard to the Reserved Question, nor will either party make any representation to the contrary.

Without prejudice to either party's position on the continued viability of any other side letter, this side letter shall continue in effect unless and until the parties agree otherwise or until the Reserved Question is decided by Arbitrator Golick.

Sincerely,
Howard Rothschild
President, RAB
