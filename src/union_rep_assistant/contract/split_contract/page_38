Article XXVII - Work Authorization and Status Disputes

27.1 The parties recognize that questions involving an employee’s work status or personal information may arise during the course of employment, and that errors in an employee’s documentation may be due to mistake or circumstances beyond an employee’s control. The parties agree to attempt to minimize the impact of such issues on both the affected employees and employers by working together to fairly resolve such issues while complying with all applicable laws.

Article XXVIII - Veteran Transition Assistance

28.1 The parties recognize that making a successful transition from the military into the civilian workforce can be challenging.

These efforts shall include, but not be limited to: (i) increasing the industry’s advertising/recruitment efforts to encourage veterans to apply for jobs within the industry; (ii) communicating with the industry about the numerous benefits associated with hiring veterans; and (iii) providing newly hired veterans with access to training through classes to be created by the Thomas Shortman School aimed at easing the transition to the civilian workforce and teaching the requisite skills.
