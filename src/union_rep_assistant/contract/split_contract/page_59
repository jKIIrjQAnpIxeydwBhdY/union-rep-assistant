Re:  Health Care Savings (Suburban Plan) and 2024 Ratification
Bonus

Dear Manny:

The parties agree that a one-time ratification bonus will be paid to certain
eligible employees (as discussed more fully below). This will confirm the
details of that ratification bonus.

In accordance with the monthly rates of contributions set forth in the
preceding side letter regarding contribution rates for officers covered by the
Suburban Plan of benefits, in 2024, the monthly rate of contribution to the
Health Fund shall be $1,797.00 per covered employee. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary above, the rate of contribution for the months of
May 2024 and June 2024 (payable respectively on or before June 20, 2024
and July 20, 2024) shall be $50.00 per month per covered employee.

After the Union provides the RAB with notice that its membership has fully
ratified this Agreement, each employee for whom the Employer is obligated
to contribute to the Health Fund for the Suburban Plan of benefits as of
July 20, 2024, including part-time employees who work more than two (2) days
per week, and those on leave for whom the employer is obligated to
contribute to the Health Fund as of July 20, 2024, shall receive a one-time,
lump-sum, ratification bonus of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00), minus all
applicable taxes, withholdings and deductions. The ratification bonus will be
paid on July 26, 2024, or 30 calendar days after ratification, whichever is
later.

The parties agree that the ratification bonus shall not be considered
compensation for hours of employment purposes, and instead shall be
deemed excluded from the definition of regular rate for purposes of
calculating overtime pay. For the avoidance of any doubt, any disputes over
the ratification bonus made to eligible employees, including any disputes
